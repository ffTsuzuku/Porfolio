# Pomodoro App

Stay focused and productive with my Pomodoro app. Unlike traditional Pomodoro apps that use jarring alarm sounds, my app features soothing meditation gong sounds for a more calming experience.

## Features

-   Customizable time presets
-   Gesture controls through Bluetooth headphone integration
-   Volume controls for different sound effects
-   Local storage for saving user settings

## Installation

-   Clone the repository
-   npm i
-   npm run dev

## Usage

After installing the app, set your desired time preset and tap the start button to begin your Pomodoro session. Pause the timer at any time using simple gesture controls via your Bluetooth headphones or UI Buttons.

Customize the volume of the different sound effects in the app to your liking and save your settings locally for future use.
